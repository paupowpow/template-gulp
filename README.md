# template-gulp
Quick start web development: A template project using Sass, Browser Sync and running on a local server.
I followed this neat [tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/gulp-for-beginners/).

## getting started
1. `brew install npm` to install npm (Node.js package manager )
2. `sudo npm install gulp -g` to install gulp
3. `gulp` to compile sass to css, start local machine and watch on changes to html, js, css files

## build
`gulp build`
