# template-webdev
Quick starting my web dev projects. Includes:

* local webserver
* sass to css
* automatic browser refresh
* tasks for optimizing assets for productions

I followed this neat [tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/gulp-for-beginners/).

## getting started
1. `brew install npm` to install npm (Node.js package manager )
2. `sudo npm install gulp -g` to install gulp
3. `gulp` to compile sass to css, start local machine and watch on changes to html, js, css files

## build
`gulp build`
