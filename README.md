# template-webdev
Quick starting my/your/our web dev projects. Includes:
* local webserver
* sass to css
* automatic browser refresh
* tasks for optimizing assets for productions

I followed this neat [tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/gulp-for-beginners/).

## requirements
Install Node.js and npm by following this [guide](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
* `node -v` to check that you have Node.js
* `npm -v` to check that you have npm installed

## setup
0. Clone the repository and be inside the directory
1. `npm install gulp` to install gulp 
2. `gulp` to compile sass to css, start local machine and watch on changes to html, js, css files

## build
`gulp build`
